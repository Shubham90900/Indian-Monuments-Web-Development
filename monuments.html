              <p class="card_text">
                In 10th century, the cholas renamed it to Chidambaram and built
                the current temple for their family deity of Nataraja Shiva. The
                word Chidambaram comes from the Tamil word Chitrambalam (also
                spelled Chithambalam) meaning "wisdom atmosphere". The roots are
                citt or chitthu means "consciousness or wisdom".This composite
                word comes from its association with Shiva Nataraja, the cosmic
                dancer and the cultural atmosphere for arts.

                said once the city was surrounded by nothing but date palm trees
                and therefore the name. But there's another story, which states
